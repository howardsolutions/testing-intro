## There are a few workshop notes:

1. Your test passed doesn't equal your code work. It just means your tests doesn't fail

2. Write test is not hard. There're only codes that hard to test.

3. Test Driven Development (TDD): Write the test first, then implement the function so the test passes.

4. TDD - It's hard to write code that's hard to test IF you start with the tests and make them pass.
